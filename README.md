rprime
======

rprime is an R package for parsing `.txt` generated by E-Prime, a program for running psychological experiments.

## Features / Goals

Main workflow for working with `rprime` involves:

1. `read_eprime`: reliably read in data from an Eprime log (`.txt`) file
2. `extract_chunks`: extract the text in each "LogFrame" in the log file
3. `function_TBA`: convert each log frame into a R `list`
4. `preview_eprime`: explore the struture of the parsed data
5. `function_TBA`: select and filter particular levels from log
6. `function_TBA`: make a `data.frame` from the parsed data
