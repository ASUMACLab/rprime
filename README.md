rprime
======

rprime is an R package for parsing `.txt` generated by E-Prime, a program for running psychological experiments.

## Features / Goals

Main workflow for working with `rprime` involves:

1. `read_eprime`: reliably read in data from an Eprime log (`.txt`) file
2. `extract_chunks`: extract the text in each `"LogFrame"` in the file
3. `make_eprime_frames`: convert each log-frame into an R list
4. `preview_levels`, `preview_eprime`: explore the structure of the parsed data
5. `keep_levels`, `drop_levels`, `filter_in`, `filter_out`: select and filter particular levels from the log
6. `to_data_frame`: make a data-frame from the parsed data

## Todo

- [ ] Write long-form documentation demoing how to handle multiple files at once
- [ ] Unit tests for `filter`s and `to_data_frame`
